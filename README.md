[AI-900 : Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/ai-900/)

# Purpose
I updated this repository to help you prepare for the AI-900 exam. Unlike other exams, this one is largely nontechnical as long as you understand the content covered in the official [learning paths](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/tianxie-0451/collections/non1b2ong5rz28). Studying [notes](StudyNotes.md) and working through [practice questions](PracticeQuestions.md) helped me pass this exam on the first try.
