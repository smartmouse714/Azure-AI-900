# Purpose
I updated this repository to help you prepare for the AI-900 exam. Unlike other exams, this one is largely nontechnical as long as you understand the content covered in the official [learning paths](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/ai-900). Studying notes and working through practice questions helped me pass this exam on the first try.
