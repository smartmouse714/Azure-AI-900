# What is AI?

AI is the creation of software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities. Key workloads include:

- Machine learning
: This is often the foundation for an AI system, and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.
- Anomaly detection
: The capability to automatically detect errors or unusual activity in a system.
In Azure, the Anomaly Detector service provides an application programming interface (API) that developers can use to create anomaly detection solutions.
- Computer vision
: The capability of software to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.
- Natural language processing
: The capability for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.
- Knowledge mining
: The capability to extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.

## Computer vision capabilities
- Image classification 
: Image classification involves training a machine learning model to classify images based on their contents. For example, in a traffic monitoring solution you might use an image classification model to classify images based on the type of vehicle they contain, such as taxis, buses, cyclists, and so on.
- Object detection 
: Object detection machine learning models are trained to classify individual objects within an image, and identify their location with a bounding box. For example, a traffic monitoring solution might use object detection to identify the location of different classes of vehicle.
- Semantic segmentation 
: Semantic segmentation is an advanced machine learning technique in which individual pixels in the image are classified according to the object to which they belong. For example, a traffic monitoring solution might overlay traffic images with "mask" layers to highlight different vehicles using specific colors.
- Image analysis
: You can create solutions that combine machine learning models with advanced image analysis techniques to extract information from images, including "tags" that could help catalog the image or even descriptive captions that summarize the scene shown in the image.
- Face detection, analysis, and recognition
: Face detection is a specialized form of object detection that locates human faces in an image. This can be combined with classification and facial geometry analysis techniques to recognize individuals based on their facial features.
- OCR
: Optical chaacter recognition is a technique used to detect and read text in images. You can use OCR to read text in photographs (for example, road signs or store fronts) or to extract information from scanned documents such as letters, invoices, or forms.

## Azure ML

Regression predicts a numeric *label* or outcome based on variables, or *features*.
Regression is an example of a *supervised* machine learning technique in which you train a model using data that includes both the features and known values for the label, so that the model learns to *fit* the feature combinations to the label. Then, after training has been completed, you can use the trained model to predict labels for new items for which the label is unknown.

To use Azure Machine Learning, you first create a *workspace* resource in your Azure subscription.
A workspace must be created before you can access Machine Learning studio. 
A dataset is required to create an automated machine learning (automated ML) run.
A job must be created in Machine Learning studio to use Machine Learning to train a regression model.

A dataset is required to create an automated machine learning (automated ML) run. A workspace must be created before you can access Machine Learning studio. An Azure container instance and an AKS cluster can be created as a deployment target, after training of a model is complete.

To deploy a predictive service from a newly trained model by using the Machine Learning designer, you must first create a pipeline in the Machine Learning designer. Adding training modules by using the Machine Learning designer takes place before creating a trained model, which already exists. Adding a dataset by using the Machine Learning designer requires that a pipeline already exists. To create an inferencing cluster, you must use Machine Learning studio.

### Azure Machine Learning compute
- Compute Instances
: Development workstations that data scientists can use to work with data and models.
- Compute Clusters
: Scalable clusters of virtual machines for on-demand processing of experiment code.
- Inference Clusters
: Deployment targets for predictive services that use your trained models.
- Attached Compute
: Links to existing Azure compute resources, such as Virtual Machines or Azure Databricks clusters.

1. Prepare data
: Identify the features and label in a dataset. Pre-process, or clean and transform, the data as needed.
2. Train model
: Split the data into two groups, a training and a validation set. Train a machine learning model using the training data set. Test the machine learning model for performance using the validation data set.
3. Evaluate performance
: Compare how close the model's predictions are to the known labels.
4. Deploy a predictive service
: After you train a machine learning model, you need to convert the training pipeline into a real-time inference pipeline. Then you can deploy the model as an application on a server or device so that others can use it.

Multiple linear regression models a relationship between two or more features and a single label, which matches the scenario in this item. 
Linear regression uses a single feature. 
Logistic regression is a type of classification model, which returns either a Boolean value or a categorical decision. 
Hierarchical clustering groups data points that have similar characteristics.

|Feature|Capability|
|-|-|
|Automated machine learning|This feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.|
|Azure Machine Learning designer|A graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.|
|Data and compute management|Cloud-based data storage and compute resources that professional data scientists can use to run data experiment code at scale.|
|Pipelines|Data scientists, software engineers, and IT operations professionals can define pipelines to orchestrate model training, deployment, and management tasks.|

*Classification* is a form of machine learning that is used to predict which category, or class, an item belongs to. This machine learning technique can be applied to binary and multi-class scenarios.

The confusion matrix is a tool used to assess the quality of a classification model's predictions. It compares predicted labels against actual labels.

In a binary classification model where you're predicting one of two possible values, the confusion matrix is a 2x2 grid showing the predicted and actual value counts for classes 1 and 0. It categorizes the model's results into four types of outcomes. Using our diabetes example these outcomes can look like:

- True Positive
: The model predicts the patient has diabetes, and the patient does actually have diabetes.
- False Positive
: The model predicts the patient has diabetes, but the patient doesn't actually have diabetes.
- False Negative
: The model predicts the patient doesn't have diabetes, but the patient actually does have diabetes.
- True Negative
: The model predicts the patient doesn't have diabetes, and the patient actually doesn't have diabetes.
